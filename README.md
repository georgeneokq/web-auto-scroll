The auto-scroll.js file contains the original source code for the auto scrolling.

The auto-scroll-inline-js.txt file contains the URL version of the script that can be used by copying and pasting it onto the browser search bar.

This has been tested to work on chrome. However, when pasted onto the bar, the 'javascript:' prefix is automatically deleted by chrome, so it is necessary to manually type it in after pasting.
